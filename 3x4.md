# 3x4 Macro pad build guide

## items needed to build are as follows
* 12 dieoeds
* 12 switches 
* 12 hot swap sockets(optional)
* 1 micro controller
* 1 pcb(this is the one with all of the holes in it)
* 1 case set 
  * 7 stand offs
  * switch plate
  * back plate 
  * acrilic cover

## The guide
### dieods
to start you are going to want to take your pcb and your 12 dieods and put them in. Do this by bending the wire leggs on the dieods and inseting them into the array of holes at the top of the macro pad. When doing this you need to make sure the black part of the dieod is 
facing the little line and the square

### micro controller 
The next thing you need to do is solder the leggs onto your micro controller to do this you you need to line up the row of pins that came with your micro controller with the row of holes on your micro controller. then you will want to insert the short side of the pins
into the back of your micro controller do them one side at a time and just be carifle to no touch any other parts of the micro controller with your iron

after this is done you can push your micro controller into your pcb again line up both rows of pins with both rows of holes on the pcb start on the back and push them in. They will take a good amount of force to push in but just take it slow and you will get it.
after you have you micro controller fully seated you should trim the extra length off your pins sticking out the back. I would not trim them flush but just a bit proud this will help if you try and remove it and reinsert it at a later date.

### hot swap sockets 
if you are forgoing hot swap sockets feel free to move onto the next section

sockets are rather simple you simply need to push them into the holes and make sure you are not covering up the center hole. solder the 2 pads on ether side

### put the plate on 
before you start take note of where the pins are on your switches and what holes you are lineing up with. snap in all 12 of your switches into your plate they should all be facing the same way then aline all of the holes and slowly press it into place.

### assamble case
next you need you put it all together
for this you need to put 3 standoffs into the pcb facing up the same side you put the micro controller and the dieods on.on top of those you can mounst your acrilyc cover.
[standoffs on pcb]()
next put 4 standoffs onto the back plate then you can put them through the holes on the pcb and screw the plate into them.
